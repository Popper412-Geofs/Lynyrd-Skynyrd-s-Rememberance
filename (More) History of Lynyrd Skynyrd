Lynyrd Skynyrd has a total of 14 studio albums. First one in 1973 named, Pronounced (Pronounced 'Lĕh-nérd Skin-nérd'). That album has their infamous Free Bird song. Their best album is Street 
Survivors released in 1977. My favorite one personally is 'Gimme Back My Bullets' album released 1976. But who am I kidding. ALL of Lynyrd Skynyrd's albums were bangers. They were so good they
had their own genre of music. Lynyrd Skynyrd *I made it up, but it's kinda true ngl*. This amazing band met in In the summer of 1964, teenagers Ronnie Van Zant, Bob Burns, and Gary Rossington
met while playing on rival baseball teams in Jacksonville, Florida. An impromptu afternoon jam session in the carport of Burns' parents' house inspired the trio to form a band. That's how they 
met and made the best fricken' band in the whole world. But their reign came to an end in October 20, 1977 18:52 (CST) when their airplane crashed in a heavily wooded swamp, Amite County, 
Mississippi, United States, five miles (8 km) northeast of Gillsburg 31°04′19″N 90°35′57″W . I'll link a YouTube video going into all of the details of it. That claimed the lives of 6 people
including front man Ronnie Van Zant. Gary Rossington and Artimus Pyle survived the crash though. But Gary Rossington, the band's last surviving founding member, died in March 2023. Then Ronnies'
Brother Jonny Van Zant is the younger brother of Ronnie Van Zant and he took over Lynyrd Skynyrd. They still make music to this day.

Here's the link to the plane crash that happened on that fateful day. I give a shout out to @TragicStories  for providing us with what happened.
